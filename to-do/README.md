  Add, edit, check/uncheck, and delete tasks with ease. Each task is its own component, managed in a modern React state array.

  Focus on what matters—your tasks. The interface is intentionally simple, with just the right amount of style.

## 💡 Why Is This Different?

Most to-do apps use a single input and a list.  
**Not Your Everyday To-Do App** gives each task its own input and checkbox, all managed in a single React state array.  
This means you can interact with every task independently, and the UI updates instantly—no lag, no reloads.
